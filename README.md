Welcome to our beautiful react / freddie and annaâ€™s glamour / oops a daisy / subtend me / flower power game.

The aim of the game is to give as many flowers to your friend as possible. Two players play the game - one uses the letter 'a' to give a flower, and the other uses the letter 'l'. The time you have depends on how many followers you have on GitHub. It is a social commentary.

PS. This game is not in a functional state. You might have to refresh the page to load assets correctly.
